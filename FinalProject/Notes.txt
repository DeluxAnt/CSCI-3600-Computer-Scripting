 convert bandit.jpg -format "%[pixel:p{75,20}]" info: | awk 'BEGIN { FS = "b"} ; {print $2}'

 - Create a way to create and popluate a 2d array with the info 
 - use loop using image dimensions to get every pixel info
 - Fill matrix by printing landscape line by line like images from 1999
 - add logic to diferentiate srbg(jpg) & srbga(png)
 - Convert RBG tuples into brightness tuples using (R+G+B)/3 

 FUN FACT: Bash doesnt support 2d arrays so they have to be simulated 
  - implementation complexity
  - performance issues
  - sparse arrays
  - complex and fragile syntax
  - separator escaping


  sed 's/.//;s/.$//' #trims starting character and ending character
